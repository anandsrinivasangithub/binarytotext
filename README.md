## About
This is just a fun project that I made (took about five minutes to make). I realized that it's quite annoying (and impossible) for some people to try and convert binary numbers to text, and while there are applications and websites that can do this, I wanted to do it too, for fun.

## How to use
It's pretty self explanatory. Put the binary numbers in the text box, click "Convert" and it'll convert your binary numbers to text!
